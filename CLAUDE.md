# Bloom Mobile App - Codebase Analysis

## Project Overview

Bloom Mobile is a React Native application built with Expo that appears to be a dating/matching app with a focus on compatibility based on both astrological factors and personality questionnaires. The app uses Supabase for authentication and database management, and Tamagui for UI components and theming.

## File Structure

The project has the following key directories:

- `database`: Contains database initialization scripts
- `src`: Contains the application's source code
  - `components`: UI components including natal chart visualization
  - `hooks`: Custom React hooks for state management and data fetching
  - `lib`: Utility libraries including Supabase client setup
  - `navigation`: Navigation structure and screens organization
  - `polyfills`: Polyfills for cross-platform compatibility
  - `screens`: Application screens including authentication, questionnaire, and matching
  - `services`: Business logic services including astrological calculations and compatibility algorithms
  - `test`: Test files for various app features
  - `theme`: Theming configuration
  - `types`: TypeScript type definitions
  - `utils`: Utility functions

## Dependencies

The project uses the following key dependencies:

- **React Native & Expo**: Core framework for cross-platform mobile development
- **Tamagui**: UI framework and theming
- **Supabase**: Authentication and database management
- **React Navigation**: Navigation between screens
- **Expo Notifications**: Push notifications
- **React Native Community Components**: Various UI components like DateTimePicker and Slider
- **Axios**: HTTP client for API requests
- **Date-fns**: Date manipulation library

## Authentication

The application uses Supabase for authentication. The `useAuth.tsx` hook provides functions for:
- Signing in with email and password
- Signing up new users
- Signing out
- Resetting passwords

The authentication state is managed through React Context and is available throughout the app via the `useAuth` hook.

## Database

The application uses Supabase as its database. The `database/init-tables.js` file initializes the database tables, including:

- `profiles`: Stores user profile information including:
  - Basic user data (name, email)
  - Birth information (date, time, location)
  - Personality ratings from questionnaires
  - Lifestyle ratings from questionnaires
  - Values ratings from questionnaires

The database uses row-level security policies to protect user data, ensuring users can only view and update their own profiles.

## Key Features

### 1. Questionnaire System

The app includes a comprehensive questionnaire (`QuestionnaireScreen.tsx`) that collects detailed user information:

- Basic information (location, birth date, country, industry)
- Relationship status and preferences
- Personality traits (rated 1-10)
- Lifestyle preferences (rated 1-10)
- Values and priorities (rated 1-10)
- Detailed relationship and communication preferences

This data is stored in the user's profile in the Supabase database and is used for matching with other users.

### 2. Astrological Compatibility

The app calculates astrological compatibility between users based on:

- Zodiac signs determined from birth dates
- Planetary aspects and their compatibility
- Element compatibility between signs

The implementation includes:
- `services/birthData.ts`: Calculates zodiac signs from birth dates
- `services/aspects.ts`: Calculates aspects between planetary bodies and their compatibility
- `services/astrological.ts`: Provides astrological compatibility details

### 3. Matching System

The app includes a matching system that:
- Retrieves potential matches from the database
- Displays match details including compatibility scores
- Allows users to accept or reject matches
- Enables messaging between matched users

### 4. Compatibility Calculation

The app calculates compatibility between users based on:
- Astrological compatibility (50% of total score)
- Questionnaire-based compatibility (50% of total score)

The `calculateCompatibility` function in `services/compatibility.ts` combines these scores to create a total compatibility score.

## Implementation Details

The app has a comprehensive implementation of compatibility calculations:

1. **Questionnaire Compatibility Calculation**: The app now calculates compatibility scores based on questionnaire data using the `calculateQuestionnaireCompatibility` function in `services/questionnaireCompatibility.ts`. This function:
   - Compares personality ratings to generate a personality compatibility score
   - Compares lifestyle ratings to generate a lifestyle compatibility score
   - Compares values ratings to generate a values compatibility score
   - Compares multiple choice answers to generate a multiple choice compatibility score
   - Combines these scores into an overall questionnaire compatibility score

2. **Astrological Compatibility Calculation**: The app calculates astrological compatibility using the `calculateAstrologicalScore` function in `services/compatibility.ts`. This function:
   - Creates natal charts from birth data
   - Calculates aspect compatibility between planetary bodies
   - Calculates element compatibility between zodiac signs
   - Combines these scores into an overall astrological compatibility score

3. **Combined Compatibility Score**: The app combines the questionnaire compatibility score and the astrological compatibility score to create a total compatibility score using the `calculateProfileCompatibility` function in `services/compatibility.ts`.

4. **Match Enhancement**: The app enhances matches with compatibility details using the `enhanceMatchWithCompatibility` function in `utils/matchUtils.ts`. This function:
   - Calculates compatibility between the user's profile and the partner's profile
   - Adds compatibility details to the match object
   - Returns the enhanced match with compatibility details

5. **Compatibility Display**: The app displays compatibility details in the `MatchScreen.tsx` file, showing:
   - Overall compatibility score
   - Astrological compatibility score
   - Personality compatibility score
   - Lifestyle compatibility score
   - Values compatibility score

## Implemented Improvements

The app has been significantly improved with the following enhancements:

1. **Enhanced Astrological Calculations**: The astrological compatibility calculation now has multiple fallback methods:
   - Integration with an astrological API for precise planetary positions
   - Simplified calculations based on birth time when API is unavailable
   - Pre-calculated ephemeris data as a fallback
   - Default planet positions as a last resort

2. **Improved Error Handling**: The app now has robust error handling throughout:
   - Custom error types for different categories of errors
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Consistent error handling patterns
   - Error logging and reporting

3. **Optimized Performance**: The app now has performance optimizations:
   - Caching for compatibility calculations
   - Pagination for match lists
   - Memory and persistent storage caching
   - Background cache refreshing

4. **Enhanced Security**: The app now has improved security:
   - Input validation for questionnaire responses
   - Rate limiting for authentication attempts
   - Data sanitization to prevent XSS attacks
   - Secure error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information

## Future Improvements

While the app has been significantly improved, there are still some areas for future enhancement:

1. **Questionnaire Weighting**: The questionnaire compatibility calculation currently weights questions by category (personality: 30%, lifestyle: 25%, values: 25%, multiple choice: 20%). This could be further improved by:
   - Allowing users to specify which aspects of compatibility are most important to them
   - Using machine learning to determine optimal weightings based on successful matches
   - Implementing a feedback system to refine weightings over time

2. **Compatibility Explanation**: The app currently displays compatibility scores but could provide more context:
   - Providing detailed explanations of why users are compatible
   - Highlighting specific areas of high compatibility
   - Suggesting conversation topics based on shared interests

3. **Advanced Matching Algorithm**: The matching algorithm could be enhanced with:
   - Machine learning to improve match quality over time
   - Consideration of user feedback on matches
   - Integration of additional compatibility factors

### 4. Real-time Features

Enhance the app with more real-time features:
- Real-time chat with typing indicators
- Push notifications for new matches and messages
- Real-time compatibility updates
- Live location sharing for meetups

### 5. Accessibility Improvements

Make the app more accessible to all users:
- Screen reader support
- Keyboard navigation
- Color contrast improvements
- Font size adjustments

## Conclusion

The Bloom Mobile app has a solid foundation with features for user authentication, profile management, questionnaires, and astrological compatibility. However, there are implementation gaps in the questionnaire-based compatibility calculations that need to be addressed to fully realize the app's potential. By implementing the suggested improvements, the app could provide a more accurate and comprehensive matching experience for users.
